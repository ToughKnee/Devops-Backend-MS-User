## Design Considerations

1. **Scalability**
   - UUID usage for primary keys
   - Separate tables for different content types
   - Efficient indexing structure

2. **Performance**
   - Denormalization where needed for read performance
   - Timestamp tracking for caching strategies
   - Efficient relationship design

3. **Security**
   - Separate admin user table
   - Role-based access control
   - Audit trail capabilities

4. **Data Integrity**
   - Foreign key relationships
   - Status tracking for content
   - Soft delete capabilities

5. **Compliance**
   - User privacy settings
   - Content moderation capabilities
   - Data retention tracking
